<h1>How to Embellish a Frame with Masking Tape
</h1>

<p>Looking for a fun, easy project to do with youngsters this summer? One that will occupy them for a good amount of time and will result in a unique finished product? The supplies are cheap and readily available, so, whatever your needs, be it a group project or just a fun hour for yourself, this is relaxing and rewarding. Nice enough to hang as a conversation piece or to give as a one of a kind gift.
