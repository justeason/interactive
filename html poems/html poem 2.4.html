<h3>Frog faces,
 frog lust,
frog bellies
 in the dust,</h3>
 <h4>till unexpected flame
 gave you another name:</h4>

<h3>( there’s the siren wail again,
 May 15;</h3>
 <h3>by the clock,
 near 6,
 that’s 4
 by the sun ):</h3>


<h3>frog faces,
 frog lust,
 frog bellies
 in the dust</h3>
 <h1>of the Last Judgement Day :</h1>


<h3>when winter-fog is gone,
 the frogs sit in the sun,</h3>
 <h5>and now you can see
 strawberry-leaves
 on a crown,
 a lion,
 a unicorn:
 </h5>
