<h3>VII
</h3>

<p>Frog faces,
 frog lust,
 frog bellies
 in the dust,<br>
 till unexpected flame
 gave you another name:
 </p>

<p>(thereâ€™s the siren wail again,
 May 15;<br>
 by the clock,
 near 6,
 by the sun ):
 </p>

<P>frog faces,
 frog lust,
 frog bellies
 in the dust<br>
 of theLast Judgement Day :
 </P>

<p>when winter-fog is gone,
 the frogs sit in the sun,<br>
 and now you can see
 strawberry-leaves<br>
 on a crown,
 a lion,
 a unicorn:
 </p>

<p>- H.D., from Last Winter, 1950
